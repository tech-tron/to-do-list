an interactive to-do list
my first attempt at making a functional web append  for all devices
features: -->
 battery icon that cycles on a frame rate
 an input method that responds on enter
 a inspiring quote API with a self made JSON
 alternating bg-color list items
 clear and remove on click


possible features:
  drag function to move list items
  a update feature that saves a history of to-do items
  a user profile
  a time estimate for the task to-do
  a predictor that helps make setting up the list daily easier


i also would like to add a "pop up add" with a qoute from my JSON
ten seconds to read and then a fad away action
maybe box fades the whole ten seconds
the words fade an additional 3
