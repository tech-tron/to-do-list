an interactive to-do list
my first attempt at making a functional web append  for all devices
features: -->
 battery icon that cycles on a frame rate
 an input method that responds on enter
 a inspiring quote API with a self made JSON
 alternating bg-color list items
 clear and remove on click


possible features:
  drag function to move list items
  a update feature that saves a history of to-do items
  a user profile
  a time estimate for the task to-do
  a predictor that helps make setting up the list daily easier
